# firebase-realtime-chat

This is a real-time chat app made with React, Typescript, Vite, and Firebase as Baas.

This project uses the real-time databases from Firebase and explores some of the concepts such as security rules, nodes, and also authentication (also handled by Firebase)

Do not forget to create a `.env` file with your firebase config object

For now, just previously authenticated users have groups and can use the chat route but this is going to be changed in the future.

**The general chat is available for anyone.**

Take a look and enjoy!
